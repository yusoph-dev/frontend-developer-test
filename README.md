    ```

2. The development server will start on http://localhost:3000. Open this URL in your web browser to view the application.

## Building for Production

1. Create a production build using npm:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. The production build files will be generated in the build directory. Deploy these files to a hosting platform like Vercel or Netlify.

## Unit Testing Using Jest

1. Browse the test file through `src/App.test.js`.

## Using the React JS Project

This React JS project is a simple e-commerce application that allows users to add items to a shopping cart. The application consists of two main components:

1. **Product:** This component displays the product details, including the product image, title, description, price, and size options. Users can add a product to their cart by selecting a size and clicking the "Add to Cart" button.

2. **Header:** This component displays the shopping cart icon and the total number of items in the cart. Users can click on the cart icon to view the cart items.
